        They are known for their flaky, buttery texture and crescent shape.<br />
        Making croissants is a labor-intensive process that involves multiple
        steps of rolling,<br />
        folding, and chilling the dough to create the flaky layers.<br />
        The dough is then shaped into crescents, proofed, and baked until golden
        brown.<br />
        While the classic croissant is plain, there are many variations
        available, including chocolate-filled, almond-filled, or savory options
        with cheese or ham. <br />
        Despite their indulgent nature, they can provide some benefits when
        enjoyed in moderation.<br />
        They can be a
        <span class="highlight">Source of energy</span>
        due to their carbohydrate content, <br />and they can also contribute to
        a feeling of satisfaction and enjoyment when consumed as part of a
        balanced diet.<br />
        <em>
          <strong
            >It's best to enjoy them occasionally as a treat rather than as a
            staple in your diet.</strong
